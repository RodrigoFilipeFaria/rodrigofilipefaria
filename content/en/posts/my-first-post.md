# A Secure Place

Many times I find myself with several conversation ideas, each enough to write a book. So, I decided to create this blog area to talk about current topics, always focusing on technology, of course, but also exploring human ethics.

It would be irrational of me not to specify what I will talk about, so here are some themes:

- The current state of Linux  
- Security problems and how to solve them  
- Current events  
- Self-hosting for a better everyday life  

I would say that most posts will be opinions about bad security practices in daily life and how to solve them, since this has been my focus for the last two years. I will be very happy to share my knowledge with you (and also receive some from you).
