## 👋 Hey, I'm Rodrigo Faria

I'm a cybersecurity and network engineer with a deep passion for infrastructure, performance, and breaking things (just to make them stronger). By day, I work across DevOps, secure systems, and backend development. By night, I'm running experiments in my homelab or crafting low-level tools in C++.

I believe in building resilient systems - whether it's through hardened firewalls, optimized protocols, or a finely tuned Proxmox cluster. My work spans from security-first architecture to performance-oriented networking, with a heavy curiosity for offensive and defensive strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Use

- **Cybersecurity**: Penetration testing, packet analysis, threat modeling  
- **Networking**: VPNs, firewalls, Wireshark, and monitoring tools  
- **Programming**: C, C++, Python, Bash, and a dash of Rust  
- **Infrastructure**: Proxmox, Docker, LXC, WireGuard, self-hosted services  
- **DevOps**: Linux, CI/CD pipelines, system automation  
- **Web**: Flask (Python), React (JS), PostgreSQL - deployed in containers

## 🧪 What I’m Working On

- A personal logging system and monitoring stack  
- Getting even deeper into kernel-level performance analysis

---

## 🎷 Bonus Fact

I'm also a musician — I spend most of my time playing saxophone in a philarmonic band.
